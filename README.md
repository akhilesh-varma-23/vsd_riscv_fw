# VSDSquadron Mini Core
The **VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V development board** - Features and Interfaces:
    - **Core Processor** - The board is powered by CH32V003F4U6 chip with 32-bit RISC-V core based on RV32EC instruction set, optimized for high-performance computing with support for 2-level interrupt nesting and supports 24MHz system main frequency in the product function
    - **Clock and Reset Systems**: Includes a built-in factory-trimmed 24MHz RC oscillator and a 128kHz RC oscillator, plus an external 24MHz oscillator option for varied clocking requirements
 Robust GPIO Support: Boasts 3 groups of GPIO ports, totaling 15 I/O ports, enabling
extensive peripheral connections and mapping to external interrupt capabilities
 Flexible Communication Interfaces: Offers multiple communication protocols including USART,
I2C, and SPI for versatile connectivity options
 High-Speed Memory: Equipped with 2KB SRAM for volatile data storage, 16KB CodeFlash
for program memory, and additional 1920B for bootloader functionalities
 On-board Programmer: Features on-board CH32V305FBP6 single-wire programming
protocol, enhancing development efficiency with seamless code deployment
and debugging. NO NEED to purchase any additional adapter
The VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V SoC device available on the development board is programmed
using the on-board flash programmer which supports the CH32V305FBP6 single-wire programming
protocol, enabling streamlined and efficient development workflows directly on the board. Connect
the VSDSquadron Mini board using a USB C connector to program the CH32V003F4U6 chip.
This repository is the official starter repository for the **VSDSquadron Mini Embedded Firmware Internship** by VLSI System Design (VSD).

The goal of this repository is to introduce participants to:
- Embedded firmware structure
- Library and API design
- How application code uses firmware libraries
- Good code organization practices used in industry

This repository will be extended throughout the internship.
