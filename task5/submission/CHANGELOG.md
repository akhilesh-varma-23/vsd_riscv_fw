## v1.0.0 – Initial Release

### Added
- Implemented **GPIO driver**
- Implemented **RCC driver** for peripheral clock control
- Added **UART debug driver** for serial communication
- Created **CLI (Command Line Interface)** module
- Added commands:
  - `help`
  - `led on`
  - `led off`
  - `blink <ms> <count>`
  - `read <pin>`

### Integrated
- **Timer/Delay module** for millisecond delays
- UART line input handling with basic editing
- LED control via GPIO
- Command parsing and validation

### Features
- Case-insensitive command parsing
- Error handling for invalid input
- Structured folder organization
- Modular driver architecture

### Known Limitations
- Blocking UART input (no multitasking)
- No interrupt-driven scheduling
- Single LED target by default

---

## Future Improvements (Planned)

- Interrupt-based UART reception
- Non-blocking scheduler
- Multiple GPIO control
- PWM command support
- Command history feature
